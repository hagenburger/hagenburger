Source of My Blog and Portfolio
===============================

This is not MIT or CC or something else, but you can have a look at it to know, how to create a blog with Staticmatic.
I’m blogging about [HTML5, Haml, Sass and Ruby on Rails](http://www.hagenburger.net).
That’s why I chose Staticmatic to create a Jekyll like static blog.
It’s very fast now :)
