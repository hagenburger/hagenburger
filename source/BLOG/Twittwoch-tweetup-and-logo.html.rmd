Twittwoch: Tweetup & Logo
=========================

Today Berlin’s first Twittwoch will take place at Coffee Karma. The name “Twittwoch” is a German combination of  “Twitter” and “Mittwoch” (= Wednesday). The event is organized by [Stefan](http://twitter.com/StefanW) and [me](http://twitter.com/Hagenburger) and promoted by [Alexander](http://twitter.com/DStartups). The hash tag is #twb. 

Here’s the logo I designed for the Twittwoch:
