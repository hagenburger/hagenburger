Made in Berlin
==============

A few days ago I discovered <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/contestshq/contests/170646/voteable_entries">a competition on a Made in Berlin badge on Facebook</a>. Maybe this was inspired by <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/#footer">the footer of 6wunderkinder</a>. Actually it was over this day. Nevertheless I made <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/344531-Made-In-Berlin">my own draft on Dribbble</a> as I like the idea.

<img src="/images/made-in-berlin/logo-variations.png" alt="made in berlin logo variations in color and style" id="logo-variations">

What are the requirements for such a logo?

- **Easy to remember:** Simple and unique
- **Some local color:** Something everybody associate with the city
- **Adaptable:** It should fit to your design—it shouldn’t be the other way round. If you like box-shadows, glows, bevel and emboss, crunge look, … the logo should allow this while keep the recognitionvalue.
- **Free to use:** Licensed under CC to allow everybody to use and adopt it.

Inspired by the font of the <a href="http://www.albert-videt.eu/photographie/carnet-de-route/berlin_02-2005/u-bahn_metrostation_alexanderplatz_00.php">station signs of the subway line U5/U8</a>. Those are styled with influence of the Bauhaus design in the 30s of the last century. The font of the Made in Berlin logo is hand-made to avoid licensing problems on the one side and provide a high legability in small sizes. At 100&nbsp;% the font has a weight of exactly one pixel (4 pixels on the columns).

I’ll soon publish the logo as SVG and PNG. Here’s the vector PSD file under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/de/">CC-BY license</a>:
