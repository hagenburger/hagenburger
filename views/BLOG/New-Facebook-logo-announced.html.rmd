New Facebook Logo Announced
===========================

**Facebook** recently [redesigned](http://mashable.com/2009/03/04/facebook-homepage-real-time/) [it’s](http://t3n.yeebase.com/social-networks-facebook-schaut-twitter-features-ab-238522/) [homepage](http://thenextweb.com/2009/03/04/facebook-twitter-unlimited-followers-real-time-homepage/). For most of us, it looks quite familiar—it looks just a small tiny little bit like [twitter](http://twitter.com/Hagenburger). So isn’t it time for facebook to think about  a logo redesign? My suggestion for the new facebook logo is:

Just kidding ;)

Do you like this logo? Maybe you’ll also like the [bracamp logo](http://www.hagenburger.net/BLOG/Social-Media-Camp-vs-bracamp.html).
