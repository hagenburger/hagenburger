    HTML5 gives us many advantages. You can use the basic [HTML5 elements like header, nav and footer in all browser](http://www.hagenburger.net/2009/03/html5-xhtml5-with-css-for-safari-firefox-opera-ie) at the moment. But there are more cool things like **canvas**, **SVG** or client side JavaScript databases. 

    While surfing I’ve found four different great overviews about XHTML5/HTML5 browser support of all features. I’ve tweeted some of them already on my Twitter account @[Hagenburger](http://twitter.com/Hagenburger)—just follow me :)

    ## 1. “When Can I Use …?”

    Alexis Deveria answers the question “When can I use …?” for HTML5 and made a great overview for “Compatibility tables for features in HTML5, CSS3, SVG and other upcoming web technologies”. You can even filter the table:

    ## 2. HTML5 Comparison of Layout Engines by Wikipedia

    #{ blog_img 'html5-overview-wikipedia-layout-engines-browser-support.png' }

    The English version of Wikipedia contains a comparison by layout engine—the render engines for each browser. The table shows Trident, Gecko, WebKit and Presto, the engines of Internet Explorer (MSIE), Firefox/Mozilla, Safari/Chrome and Opera. They are grouped by **Web Forms 2.0** and **Web Applications 1.0** (elements, attributes, …).

    ## 3. WHATWG’s “List of Known Implementations of HTML 5 in Web Browsers”

    #{ blog_img 'html5-overview-whatwg-browser-support.png' }

    Just an unordered list. No table. But with all links to the specifications.

    ## 4. WHATWG’s Sections

    Romain Gaucher made an overview with all sections by WHATWG. But at the moment it’s a bit incomplete.
