  :markdown
    For my most recent project, I had to share a git repository with another Rails developer. He also had to make deploys on my server. As my server has many projects, I though about having another way than giving him access via SSH for cap deploy. 
    
    I remembered [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) automatically deploys Rails apps after commits. So here’s how you can have the same functionality with pure Git.

    Configuration of SSH And Users
    ------------------------------

    I’m assuming the following configuration:

    Git repository
    :   /home/git/awesome-rails-app.git
    
    Deploy path
    :   /var/www/awesome-rails-app
    
    Git user
    :   git
    
    Deploy user
    :   deploy
    
    Authentication
    :   with SSH keys

    First, create a SSH key for the user git (unless you already did so) and add it for for the deploy user and vice versa:

        # log in as git:
        ssh-keygen -t rsa
        # log in as deploy:
        cat /home/git/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/deploy/authorized_keys
        ssh-keygen -t rsa
        # log in as git:
        cat /home/deploy/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/git/authorized_keys

    Installing the Git Hook
    -----------------------

    Git offers [some hooks](http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html), where you can add your own code. The most interestion hook for having a deploy is “post-receive”. Just add the deploy command:

        # File: /home/git/awesome-rails-app.git/hooks/post-receive
        #!/bin/sh

        cd /var/www/awesome-rails-app/current && cap deploy:migrations

        ## If Git isn’t on the same server as the application:
        # ssh deploy@deploy-server.com \
        #   'cd /var/www/awesome-rails-app/current && cap deploy:migrations'
        ## Don’t forget to add the SSH keys.

    Make this file executable:

        chmod +x /home/git/awesome-rails-app.git/hooks/post-receive

    Finish
    ------

    Now it should work:

        # on your local mashine:
        git push origin master

    You’ll see all commands of the cap deploy:migrations process in your console.
